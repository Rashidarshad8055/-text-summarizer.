Overview
The Text Summarizer project aims to automatically generate a concise and coherent summary of a given text while retaining its most important information. This project uses advanced Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, such as extractive and abstractive summarization models, to process and summarize long pieces of text. The primary goal of this project is to help users quickly digest large amounts of text, saving time and effort when dealing with lengthy documents, articles, or reports.

Features
Extractive Summarization: Identifies the most important sentences or phrases from the original text and extracts them to form a summary.
Abstractive Summarization: Generates new sentences that paraphrase and summarize the original content in a more natural manner.
Multi-format Support: Can process different input formats, such as plain text, PDFs, and articles.
Customizable Length: Users can specify the length or percentage of the summary they desire.
